# kidfo - Kid Info
An Iphone application to help track the life events of the children of Source

### Information Tracking
This application will track very basic information on each child, initially
including:
- Name
- Birth date
- Multiple photos
- Multiple life event notes

Other information that may be interesting to track in the future would include:
- Parent contact information if applicable and available
- Sibling information if applicable
- Date they arrived at the center
- Date they left the center
These items could be viewed as just additional life events
